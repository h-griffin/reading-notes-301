because of how fast technology is growing, and constantly advancing, designer want to know what is best for all users, resulting in responsive web design. Ethan Marcott coined the term responsive web design, which is designing a website suitable for all screen sizes and OS. mobile sites commonly have a seperate website on a new domain specifically for mobile viewing, however this has its own issues. 

flexible grides are used so adjust to the screen size, wsing relative measurements such as em. however CSS3 introduces vw, vh, vmin, and vmax. these referr to the viewport measurements. because the viewports have different sized when designing you cannot use ox and inches because it gives too much constraint and there is not enough flexibility. to find the correct measurement you use : target รท context = result. with this youre taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of the parent. 

media queries specify different styles for different browser and device circumstances.

JQuery is a much faster way of executing javascript functions, and lets you use css selectors to write the functions. JQueary ahs a library of javascript that you need to link into your html just like a css file or javascript file. JQueary is supported on all browsers, it does not need fallback code. 

Jqueary objects that reference one object (ul) will have one index ([0]) while references that return more than one (li) will have more than one index to reference ([0, 1, 2, 3]). JQ objects do not create new htmel elements, they only hold references to the elements.
